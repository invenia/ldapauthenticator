# localldapauthenticator
Simple LDAP Authenticator Plugin for Jupyter.

This authenticator has been edited from the original to include a
pre-spawning function to create a user on the host machine for each
authenticated LDAP username.

## Usage ##

You can enable this authenticator with the following lines in your
`jupyter_config.py`:

```python
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'ldapauthenticator.LDAPAuthenticator'
```

### Required configuration ###

At least the following two configuration options must be set before
the LDAP Authenticator can be used:

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.server_address` ####

Address of the LDAP Server to contact. Just use a bare hostname or IP,
without a port name or protocol prefix.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.bind_dn_template` ####

Template to use to generate the full dn for a user from the human readable
username. For example, if users in your LDAP database have DN of the form
`uid=Yuvipanda,ou=people,dc=wikimedia,dc=org` where Yuvipanda is the username,
you would set this config item to be:

```
c.LDAPAuthenticator.bind_dn_template = 'uid={username},ou=people,dc=wikimedia,dc=org'
```

The `{username}` is expanded into the username the user provides.

### Optional configuration ###

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.allowed_groups` ####

LDAP groups whose members are allowed to log in. This must be
set to either `False` (the default, to disable) or to a list of
full DNs that have a `member` attribute that includes the current
user attempting to log in.

As an example, to restrict access only to people in groups
`researcher` or `operations`,

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.allowed_groups = [
    'cn=researcher,ou=groups,dc=wikimedia,dc=org',
    'cn=operations,ou=groups,dc=wikimedia,dc=org'
]
```

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.valid_username_regex` ####

All usernames will be checked against this before being sent
to LDAP. This acts as both an easy way to filter out invalid
usernames as well as protection against LDAP injection attacks.

By default it looks for the regex `^[a-z][.a-z0-9_-]*$` which
is what most shell username validators do.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.use_ssl` ####

Boolean to specify whether to use SSL encryption when contacting
the LDAP server. Highly recommended that this be left to `True`
(the default) unless there are very good reasons otherwise.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.server_port` ####

Port to use to contact the LDAP server. Defaults to 389 if no SSL
is being used, and 636 is SSL is being used.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.add_local_user` ####

Boolean to specify whether to create a user on the host machine 
corresponding to the authenticated user if they do not already
exist.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.add_user_cmd` ####

The command to use to create the user on the host machine. The
username will be appended to the end of the command.

## Compatibility ##

This has been tested against an OpenLDAP server, with the client
running Python 3.4. Verifications of this code workign well with
other LDAP setups welcome, as are bug reports and patches to make
it work with other LDAP setups!
